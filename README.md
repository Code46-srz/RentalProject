Property Rental/Buy website project  inspired by Zillow built on laravel 
NOTE: I can really build this project in any framework and language Laravel was a just a choice made due to expirence from 
previouse employement also i want to note this project is not yet complete but i do want to share my skills as i 
move foward in completeing it.
I am using AWS S3 for storage and I have connected my mysql db to AWS RDS to give some logic to the objects that are stored in S3
at the moment. 
The Gif looks a little weird something about ffmpeg mp4 to gif conversion causing some sort of odd patterns also the website does adapt 
to different screen sizes since it uses bootstraps row and column system. 
Here is a GIF demonstrating the website in its early stages!
