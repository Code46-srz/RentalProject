Property Rental/Buy websit project built on laravel 
NOTE: i can really build this project in any framework and language Laravel was a choice made due to expirence from 
previouse employement also i want to note this project is not yet complete but i do want to share my skills as i 
move foward in completeing.
I am using AWS S3 for storage and I have connected my mysql db to AWS RDS to give some logic to the objects that are stored in S3
at the moment. 
Here is a GIF demonstrating the website in its early stages!
